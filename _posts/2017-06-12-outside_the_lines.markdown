It's been a different journey than I expected when I started this program. 

Finishing up the remaining days of teaching and moving into summer break, my natural rhythm of work has been disrupted by these classes (in a welcome way). I'm used to the bell ringing, the students screaming, and then settling in by the pool for the really long weekend. Now, there's always something to do, something new to learn. 

Speaking of that learning. Completing the HTML/CSS coursework I discovered something in the lessons that I knew I would have to do sooner or later. Turned out to be sooner. 

Doing the positioning lessons and doing the shoe store assignment, I found that I couldn't quite complete the lesson and there were a few divs that just wouldn't sit right. Everything was floating all over the place. Clearfix wasn't doing what I needed it to do. Shoes on shoes on shoes. A nightmare for a student like me where everything has to be *just* right. And the only answer I had for the problem was, "I don't know." 

Then I remembered that I have a HTML/CSS book lying around for my own personal study (I'm an English teacher; I have to have the book for it) and decided to see if I could find the fix in there. And sure enough, the solution. Things literally were *floating* all over the place. Fixing my floats in my CSS and *voila*. Everything started to sit perfectly. 

I think that was the real lesson for me in that assignment. It didn't have much to do with HTML or CSS. It had to do with using available resources to solve problems. Even though I'm relatively new on my journey as a programmer, finding and using these resources and having them on hand seems more valuable now that it's an experience I've had. I knew there would be problems, and I knew that Google and Stack Overflow would be the most valuable bookmarks I have, but making it a part of my process of work has strengthened concepts from the lessons. 

It's also made it a little easier to say, "I don't know".
