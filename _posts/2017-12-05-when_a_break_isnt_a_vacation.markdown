It's been a long time since I've posted. 

There's been a lot of changes since the last posting and the last time I delved into the Full-Stack Web Development lessons here at Flatiron. Job changes, life changes (married, a new house!), and family illness have really kept me away from sitting down and giving the lessons the focus that's required of them. 

And let me tell you...

So I returned to the lessons where I left off: smack in the middle of learning about iteration in arrays leading into hashes. So, quite confusing jumble of information to return to. But! The thing I found interesting and then very helpful when working with these data structures and how we access them was the lesson that included the Romeo and Juliet infographic. 

Seeing the "tree form" of information nesting being presented like that as opposed to the coded hash form of: 

```
epic_tragedy = {
   :montague => {
      :patriarch => {name: "Lord Montague", age: "53"},
      :matriarch => {name: "Lady Montague", age: "54"},
      :hero => {name: "Romeo", age: "15", status: "alive"},
```

Making this visual connection to the note-taking practices I had used for much of my education really made the structure of hashes and how they store information much clearer for me. 

Next, when iterating through these levels of information and wanting to act on them with methods, the usual phrase when I'm talking to myself through this process is "to dig" through the information. Seeing how the in-line coded form of nested hashes and then thinking about how that would appear in my "note-taking" form made acting on these nested hashes even clearer as well. I could see how `.each` would work on the hashes and allow me to "dig" through them to the next level and pull the information I wanted. 

Lastly, it was also interesting to see how APIs present information in this nested hash form (like the example API of the doctors in NYC participating in REACH). This "real-world" example of information made working with the labs in nested hashes and iteration that much more interesting as the future work with this information seemed more tangible, thus motivating, when I was working through the labs. 

Now that I've wrapped up Procedural Ruby (Regex is still confounding, but I'm getting there with all the cheat sheets of special characters and Rubular by my side), OO Ruby is next up. 

Time to get to work.
