One of the biggest challenges in teaching is, of course, the students. The second challenge beyond wrangling the minds and attitudes of adolescents? Entrusting your career (re: life) to them. No small challenges. 

I've taught in urban schools for 7 years now, and I began to realize that, personally, the solutions to those particular challenges were unsustainable for me. I began to feel more anxious, a co-pilot to my own life, and a dwindling voice when it came to my career. My school district and state legislature recently made sweeping changes to our education policies and practices and being at the bottom of the hill where the effects of these changes ended up didn't seem like a bright place to be. 

So, like everyone else, I Googled. And I Googled some more. 

It seems the search isn't an unpopular one: moving on from teaching to a new career. The number of results alone was enough to both give me pause and yet some confirmation in the form of solidarity; I wasn't alone. Eventually after hearing radio advertisements on our local public broadcasting station about a coding bootcamp (Software Guild) and my interest in web development from other educational pursuits, I clarified my search to coding. And then I found Flatiron. 

The rest is search history. 

But more specifically, I am pursuing coding and web development because it's creative. There is an autonomy to it that is refreshing. And, still in that autonomy, there is collaboration. All of the things I loved about teaching were possible with coding. All of my frustrations with the teaching profession were answered in the form of freedom that coding allowed. 

I started the Intro to Ruby course and couldn't stop pushing through the labs. The problem-solving, the debugging, what was supposed to be frustrating, was probably the most fun for me. The alchemy of turning a failed test into a passed test by changing a few lines of code was addictive. I knew this one small step was going to turn into a giant leap when my fiance hurried me along to go to dinner and my reply was, "Yeah. Just a sec. Let me finish one more lab." And "one more lab" turned into "I'm close to figuring out this problem" and finally "just a few more labs; the next few sound fun!" 

**Just a few more labs. **
